## Overview

This is a 3-column preview card component challenge provided by Frontend Mentor.

### The challenge

To create a 3-column preview card component

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learn how to implement the flexbox properities and majorly it helped to learn me the Mobile-first workflow.

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
<p>Enjoyed Mobile-first workflow.</p>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  learned: flexbox;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log("ðŸŽ‰");
};
```

### Continued development

I would love to improve this by using grid layout and by learning sass.
Lets enjoy the development
